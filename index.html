        <div class= "about-desc">

            <div class="about-text">
            <p>Whether you are trying to avoid chemicals or are just looking to experiment with some new hair care products, try natural oils such as coconut, argan, jojoba, almond, olive and grapeseed. These are some of the best oils for hair health and can be used directly on the skin and hair. Essential oils, such as lavender and lemongrass, also possess many qualities that help nourish and strengthen hair, while leaving it looking and smelling great.

                As more people are adopting healthier lifestyles, including eating foods that are organic and GMO-free, so goes the same trend in beauty products. Green beauty products are rapidly gaining popularity, with more women than ever wanting to use natural products. A recent Harris Poll survey revealed 53 percent of women over age 18 use all-natural hair care products. Since there are so many choices, many women wonder which oils are the best to use in their hair. </p>

                        <hr>
                        <p>Curly hair tends to become dry easily. Excessively shampooing your hair can suck out its natural moisture. Also, look for moisturizing ingredients in your conditioner. Conditioning makes sure that your hair cuticle is sealed and protected against environmental damage After washing your hair, simply run your fingers through your hair. Never ever brush your wet hair as it is more prone to breakage and damage.</p>
